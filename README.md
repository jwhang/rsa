===
Networked RSA communication demonstrator. Hoster creates a chat room which other users can join with the host's ip and port number. Messages are sent mod N and raised to a power e, which are specified by the user. The chat room contains a list of users and each of their public keys N and e. The decryption key d is generated by the program and is set as the default but the user can change what he/she decrypts with in an attempt to decode an intercepted message.

Uses the netgame/common package distributed by David Eck (http://math.hws.edu/javanotes/).
